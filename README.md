## About

This is a small project to get to know Javascript and HTML/CSS by building a basic web calculator, that does:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Technologies

This web app is build with vanilla Javascript and HTML/CSS, inspired by a tutorial.

## Improvements

 It needs some improvements, like:
 - To have a display limit on how big numbers can the user select.
 - To add the ability, to change operations in the middle of another one (before you add the second operand).
 - To add more operations and functions.
